**definition:**
HTTP client api for Ruby

Net::HTTP provides a rich library which can be used to build HTTP user-agents. For more details about HTTP see [RFC2616](www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)

Net::HTTP is designed to work closely with URI. URI::HTTP#host, URI::HTTP#port and URI::HTTP#request_uri are designed to work with Net::HTTP.

If you are only performing a few GET requests you should try OpenURI.
